/**
 * Backing store for rotating refresh tokens. The interface lives in
 * {@code common} so it can be injected into the auth-center filter
 * chain and the refresh/logout controllers without leaking Spring
 * Data Redis types into the shared module. The production impl
 * ({@code RedisRefreshTokenStore}) is in auth-center.
 *
 * <p>Design follows RFC 9700 §4.14 (OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current
 * Practice, Jan 2025):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Refresh tokens are opaque, single-use, and rotated on every
 *       use ({@link #rotate}).</li>
 *   <li>Reuse of an already-rotated token triggers <em>family
 *       revocation</em> — every token in the same family is wiped,
 *       forcing the legitimate user to re-authenticate. This is the
 *       RFC 9700 §4.14.2 MUST.</li>
 *   <li>Raw tokens are never stored at rest. Callers pass the raw
 *       value to {@code mint} / {@code rotate} / {@code revokeToken}
 *       and the implementation is responsible for hashing before
 *       persistence.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The store is the source of truth for refresh-token validity;
 * the {@code users.refresh_token} DB column is dead code under this
 * contract and will be removed in a follow-up migration.
